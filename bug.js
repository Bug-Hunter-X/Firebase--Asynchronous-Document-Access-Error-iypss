The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the promise returned by `getDoc()` has resolved. This can happen if you try to read the data synchronously, or if you're not handling the promise correctly. For example, if you have a function that retrieves a document and immediately tries to access a field, the field might be undefined if the data hasn't loaded yet.
